# Socket_server_client

This is a basic socket server and client built in Python. 

To run, clone the code to your desktop, open up two terminal windows and navigate to the directory in each window. Then execute the following command in one terminal:

```
python3 socket_server.py
```

Then in the other terminal window execute the following command:

```
python3 socket_client.py
```

You should see a printout of Hello in the server window and a printout of Hi in the client window.
